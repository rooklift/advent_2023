# Strategy for Part 2:
# Traverse the loop
# Clear all non-loop spots to be dots, i.e. "."
# Now traverse the loop again:
#	If a dot is seen on the LEFT (from the POV of the traversal) flag it
# Flood fill the flags through the dots
# The flagged dots should now (I hope) be either all of the inside dots, or all of the outside dots
